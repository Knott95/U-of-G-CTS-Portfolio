        <h3>Introduction:</h3>  
        <section> 
            <p>
                I wanted to utilize the visual power of the timeline format to show how the Game & Watch line draws upon older technology that is 5, 15 or even over 50 years old and leverages it to provide a quality and fun gaming experience. It's the perfect format to illustrate Yokoi’s “lateral thinking with withered technology" design philosophy. In a time where new and highly advanced technology is being pushed upon us everyday as the inevitable and only way forward for our society, the Game & Watch line shows that a lot can be done technologically with seemingly little, mirroring the <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelyiinshihjie/the-unexpected-comeback-of-analog-why-the-world-is-falling-back-in-love-with-cassettes-film-adc88b4fe3fe" target="_blank">back to analog</a> counter narrative that is hitting the mainstream today. I also wanted to use the timeline to show how the line was pioneering in many ways, such as the clamshell design, to demonstrate how a piece of technology can reach into the future and contribute its ideas to form the bedrock of what comes next. Lastly, I wanted to demonstrate how solid the nearly 50 year old design of the various units were that Nintendo is still leveraging them years later for their core systems as well as niche collector's items.

        <h3>Research Surprises:</h3>

                Despite being a huge Nintendo fan, I had not delved deep into the life of Gunpei Yokoi, as he is often overshadowed by bigger figures from the company such as Miyamoto or Tezuka. However, I did know the skeleton of his contributions and how he had left the company after the failure of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/VirtualFailure/mode/2up" target="_blank">Virtual Boy</a>. It was because of this that I had assumed he was still alive today, either working at another company or retired. So it was heartbreaking to research his story and design methodologies, only to realize he was taken from us too soon, and that all I had read barely scratched the surface of his life. Thus, I wanted to make his contributions one of the core focuses of the timeline, to shine more light on the man that defined the infant years of handheld gaming, which is more prevalent than ever today through mobile platforms. I also did not know how far back the Game & Watch line reached for its technology. Since it is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181130000851/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~pinwhiz/g%26w.htm" target="_blank">nearly 50 year old brand</a> and given a new technology's propensity to be bundled with the words “cutting edge” in modern day, I thought LCD’s were about as old as the first units. So it was a shock to see that the Game & Watch leveraged technology that was <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6487587" target="_blank">16 years old</a> at the time of release. Additionally, I was unaware of the clamshell design’s roots in makeup compacts, and in researching the history of those, I truly realized how far back the bedrock a single piece of hardware stands on can go. Paradoxically, this is usually not immediately evident because the technologies are so old, they themselves have become an invisible fixture of everyday reality.

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>

                Timelines are excellent tools for visualizing the historical context and impact of a given object up to, during, and after its period of dominance. They particularly excel at concretely visualizing the otherwise illusive distance between moments in time, especially when the viewer is unfamiliar with the subject matter. They can also depict with clarity how the particular series of events depicted build on each other to inform the creation of and response to the object of interest. I learned timelines can create a vivid perspective on a technology, and materialize the foundations they stand on, instead of being treated as if they had manifested from thin air. They can depict the interconnectivity of the technological developments and social factors that caused its creation, and the impact it leaves on future technology as well as greater society in the years, decades, or even centuries after its introduction.
