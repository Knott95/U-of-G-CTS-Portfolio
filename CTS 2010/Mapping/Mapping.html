        <h3>Introduction:</h3>  
        <section> 
            <p>
                This map follows a 3 act structure of sorts. Firstly, it shows the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6487587" target="_blank">invention of liquid crystal displays</a> and how that creation roamed about the world being applied and innovated. Then, it refocuses on a few key beats of Gunpei Yokoi’s life, in relation to the Game & Watch, moving about a much smaller locale. This is to stand in contrast with how much geography a single individual's creation can cover, compared to the relatively much smaller geographic locality of their life. Then, the map explodes back out, showing how the Game & Watch bounced all over the world, touching countless lives, much like the tech it derives from. This map overall seeks to visually convey how the extremely small geographic scale of a single impetus, whether that be a discovery or the life of an individual, can then greatly reach outward to directly or indirectly influence lives in many places far across the globe.

        <h3>Research Surprises:</h3> 
        <section>    
            <p>
                The many distribution companies involved across the world for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181130000851/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~pinwhiz/g%26w.htm" target="_blank">nearly 50 year old</a> and relatively niche technology is obviously not that well documented. So while researching a single thread the story can morph and change as one follows a series of fan and collectors forums from the last 30 years until a single solid and verifiable source can be found. Additionally, I was hoping to track more of the supply chain of the Game & Watch, but that idea was dashed pretty quickly due to a lack of documentation as well. While I initially pivoted to more of the distributions research and then refined and combined the points I had mapped with information from my timeline research to craft the story mentioned in the paragraph above, I realized while researching that there was enough information to map an “ideas supply chain”. It would place the core concepts and discoveries that influenced the technology as well as successor technologies that draw from it, using the Game & Watch as a sort of pivot point. However I decided that too closely resembled my <a href="https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/Knott95/U-of-G-CTS-Portfolio/blob/main/CTS%202010/Timeline/Timeline.html" target="_blank">timeline</a> and that I should stick with my original story.

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>

                I learned map making is far more multi-dimensional than a timeline, in both a literal and figurative sense. Timelines are one dimensional, and follow the pretty apparent structure of placing handpicked events in the order they occurred. Maps, however, are reducing physical 3-dimensional places into 2-dimensional ones that then must be navigated to maintain a perception of those 3-dimensional locations. Additionally, while <a href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/" target="_blank">StoryMapJS</a> moves users through the story linearly, the groupings of selected points are far less obvious than simply placing them in order of happening. While that is one possible way to go, the author can choose to break chronology and choose any other number of groupings, such as groupings based on distance or similarity of content, without it feeling as jarring as breaking the rigid order of a timeline. For example, I chose to leverage this freedom to geographically contrast the tight knit group of points that can define a single life versus the globe trotting set of points that tracks an idea or technology originating from that individual. Maps also require retrieval of location information such as the addresses of companies or labs being discussed, such as the many distribution companies I had to track down for my map. This requires extra sources compared to a timeline, as when sourcing information for an event, date information often comes bundled in. Meanwhile it is unlikely a list of contributors or distributors will have location specifics beyond country or city.
